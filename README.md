## About the App
<i>ðŸ”¨ Work in Progress ðŸ”¨</i>
<p>
  An iOS habit tracking app that allows users to input habits that they want to create or break â€“ inspired by apps like <i>Forest</i> and streaks in <i>Snapchat</i>, as well as the book <i>Atomic Habits</i>. 
  There is research that shows how the initial gamification of behavior drives the creation of habits, and thatâ€™s what drives the benefits of my app. Breaking the habit chain would be the unsatisfying, therefore making it easier to commit to your desired behavior.
